# CodyMaze

A simple Telegram bot that challenges you in an ‚ÄúHour of Code‚Äù-style game, with coding-based challenges that must be solved by physically moving on a full-scale chessboard.

## Introduction

In the context of the recent push for modern educational tools for teachers, which aim at bringing so-called ‚Äúcomputational thinking‚Äù to the classroom and thus encourage young children to acquire basic logical and coding skills, several different programming-based games have been developed and proposed (for instance, the web-based [Hour of Code challenge](https://hourofcode.com) on Code.org).

The University of Urbino has developed several tools based on messaging bots, to deliver portable, affordable, and easy to use games to teach coding in larger classrooms.
The first of these initiatives is ‚Äú[Code Hunting Games](http://codehunting.games)‚Äù, that allows users to create coding-based treasure hunts.

## The game

CodyMaze is a simple and portable ‚Äúpublic square‚Äù game: it can be easily reproduced (using 9 sheets of paper and/or other objects) and installed in any larger open space, including classrooms or playgrounds.
The players are guided through a dynamically generated maze: the bot will send out instructions (in the form of code snippets) that the players must follow in order to reach their destination (thus executing the code).
If players successfully reach their destination and complete the maze, they will receive a completion certificate.

### The chessboard

The CodyMaze chessboard is a 5√ó5 grid, rows are numbered from 1 to 5, columns from A to D.
The chessboard is oriented, so that players can identify 4 cardinal directions as shown in the following figure.

Each chessboard square is identified with a special QR&nbsp;Code, which allows the Telegram bot to determine in which square the player is currently located.
[QR&nbsp;Codes must be downloaded and printed](http://codemooc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CodyMaze-QRCodes.zip) on paper sheets.
The codes must be arranged as shown in the figure above.
To ensure that QR&nbsp;Codes do not move, they can be attached to carboard boxes, tin cans, or other objects.
The chessboard can optionally be drawn in chalk or using tape.

Some of the squares are marked by a ‚Äústar icon‚Äù. ‚≠ê
Instructions of the CodyMaze bot, in the later part of the game, will include conditional operators that depend on whether a ‚Äústar‚Äù is on the square currently occupied by the player or not.

### Player requirements

Each player will have to satisfy the following requirements in order to play:

* A smartphone with a camera and a Telegram client (registration to the messenger service is free). Known supported operating systems are iOS, Android, and Windows Phone ([Unigram](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N97ZCKPD60Q) is suggested as a Telegram client),
* Data connection or Wi-Fi,
* A QR&nbsp;Code scanner app. Many mobile operating systems have scanning capabilities built in the native camera applications. Otherwise, several scanner applications exist (we suggest these apps for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qrcode-barcode/id811899990?l=en&mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android), [Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH08M95)).

### How to play?

In order to start the game, you must move to one of the chessboard‚Äôs outer squares (that is, any square on the first or last row, or on the first or last column).
Scan in the QR&nbsp;Code you find there and follow the instructions of the bot.

At each step, the bot will **ask for your orientation** (in terms of the cardinal directions as indicated in the figure above) and will then provide you with an **instruction** to follow.
The command is composed of basic instructions such as `f` for ‚Äúmove one step forward‚Äù, `l` for ‚Äúturn left‚Äù, and `r` for ‚Äúturn right‚Äù.
Other, more complex, instructions such as `while`, `if`, and `else` will be used as the game progresses.

After executing the instructions given by the bot and arriving on a new square (which in some cases can be the same square from which you started), you must **scan the square‚Äôs QR&nbsp;Code**.
The bot will confirm that you have reached the correct destination.

If‚Äîat any point‚Äîyou fail to correctly follow the instructions, the bot will tell you so and will let you move back to a previous position.

The game is over after **13** correctly executed instructions.
