# CodyMaze

“Public square coding”: a simple Telegram bot that allows you to physically play with coding challenges on a full-scale chessboard.

## Introduction

In the context of the recent push for modern educational tools for teachers, which aim at bringing so-called “computational thinking” to the classroom and thus make it possible for young children to acquire basic logical and coding skills, several different programming-based games have been developed and proposed (for instance, the web-based [Hour of Code challenge](https://hourofcode.com) on Code.org).

The University of Urbino has developed several tools based on messaging bots, to deliver portable and easy to use games to teach coding in larger classrooms.
The first of these initiatives is “[Code Hunting Games](http://codehunting.games)”, that allows users to create coding-based treasure hunts.

## The game

CodyMaze is a simple and portable “public square” game: it can be easily reproduced (using 9 sheets of paper and/or other objects) and installed in any larger open space, including classrooms or playgrounds.
The players are guided through a dynamically generated maze: the bot will send out instructions (in the form of code snippets) that the players must follow in order to reach their destination (thus executing the code).
If players successfully reach their destination and complete the maze, they receive a completion certificate.

The Telegram bot running the game can be reached at [@codymazebot](https://t.me/codymazebot).
QR&nbsp;Codes required to run the game can be [downloaded here](http://codemooc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CodyMaze-QRCodes.zip).
